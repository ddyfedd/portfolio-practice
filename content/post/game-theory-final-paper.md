# Is Game Theory a good model for explaining altruism? 

## Disclaimer

This assignment was submitted as part of my Philosophy of Mind and Language 1 seminar during my Research Master Programme at [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/), and received a final grade of 8.5/10. It has not been published by any official publishers, so here I publish it as a practice.

## Introduction

In my essay, I am trying to answer the question of whether using Game Theory or specifically the Prisoner’s Dilemma is a tenable approach towards explaining altruistic behavior from an evolutionary perspective. The main motivation underlying my inquiry originates from our group project dealing with the phenomenon of cooperative breeding. While researching the topic and the connected literature, I found altruism as the most interesting of the answers evolutionary scientists offered to how and why cooperative breeding as a form of social systems evolved. This main idea got me going on a road that enabled me to get acquainted with other concepts present in evolutionary sciences, such as Game Theory, kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and many more. If not for anything else, this group project was fruitful in the sense, that I gained a more detailed insight into such ideas that were either not known or just superficially known by me.

For the main purpose of my essay, that is, to provide an answer to whether Game Theory is a feasible model to explain altruism/altruistic behavior, first I briefly explore the theory of kin selection, as I find it as the most compelling theory in evolutionary sciences for explaining the basic phenomena involved in altruistic behavior or the corresponding cost/benefit calculations each individual makes while deciding whether to engage in such activities that do not necessarily benefit – either directly or indirectly – the donor of the action. The main question, that kin selection tries to answer, is: why is it beneficial to help others, while bearing unwanted costs and risks with helping?

After presenting kin selection and the formula developed by W. D. Hamilton (1964), I turn towards possible alternative answers of helping behaviors, as I find kin selection theory lacking in the respect that it cannot decisively account for cases where the degree of relatedness between the individuals are low or zero. While kin selection is a great mathematical explanation for genetically backed cooperation, there seem to be cases that require a more refined answer, such as helping non-kin individuals.

These kinds of doubts towards kin selection were the basis of my next step towards altruism, where I found Robert Trivers and his article about the evolution of reciprocal altruism (1971). The main motivation for developing his conception is also alike to mine, Trivers found kin selection as only accounting for a narrow range of cases while lacking in explaining a wide range of other kinds of cooperative behaviors.

He presents his ideas by presenting the basic conditions for the evolution of more elaborate biological parameters, which enable the appearance of reciprocally altruistic behavior. Trivers (1971), similar to Hamilton (1964), grounds his theory on the prisoner’s dilemma, found in Game Theory, and moves on to back up his ideas by presenting some life forms that he considers showing altruistic behaviors.

Although Trivers’s (1971) theory became one of the most accepted explanations of altruism, I felt his examples somehow out of place, like he is trying to show me something by pointing to things that do not represent exactly or at most only partly, what he wants to prove. Fueled by this intuition, I found that Trivers (1971) and his theory of reciprocal altruism have been the target of criticism. Stephen I. Rothstein and Raymond Pierotti (1988) presented a reasonable critique that confirmed my suspicions about Trivers. They showed that using Game Theory as a model to explain altruistic behavior is not necessarily a viable way, as Game Theory uses a rather specific setting for cost/benefit calculations that are hardly representative of real-life situations. Instead, while presenting a framework to differentiate between the various types of cooperative and beneficent behaviors, they came up with a simpler explanation that can be applied to a wider range of situations.

This desire to find a more inclusive explanation of altruism led me to my reasons to disbelieve in the validity of a model based on the prisoner’s dilemma, but to reach this conviction I had to go through the steps presented above. Now, I turn to explain the separate steps of my journey more in detail.

## Kin selection

Cooperative breeding is a concept generally used in biology, referring to such a social system where, besides an infant’s parents, other group members take part in raising an offspring. By engaging in cooperative breeding, the species in question could gain a valuable evolutionary advantage over those, not engaging in such social systems. For example, the chance of a human’s offspring to survive until maturity is almost two times larger, when compared to wild chimpanzee populations. (Kramer, 2015) This feature, combined with the relatively short birth intervals doubles surviving fertility. Mothers are facing evolutionary pressure towards meeting the needs of several offsprings from different ages, which requires varying types of time and energy investments. A natural reaction to this evolutionary pressure is to involve other helpers in the breeding process, by such coordinative activities as the division of labor.

Cooperative breeding occurs relatively rarely among animals, only in around 2-3% of species. Although it seems uncommon, cooperative breeding has evolved on several occasions across different species. The general assumption is that the help received by an infant comes approximately 50% from the mother, whereas the other 50% is provided by other kin or non-kin individuals, like fathers, grandmothers, siblings, etc.

This behavior, namely, to participate in the upbringing of an offspring from another descent, raises two evolutionary questions: (1) ‘why spend time and energy to support another’s reproductive interests?’, and (2) ‘does helping make a difference to maternal fitness and child well-being?’ (Kramer, 2015)

The main feature here is the raise of inclusive fitness either of the helper or the one receiving the help. Whether helping behavior would be favored, is dependent on the formula proposed by Hamilton (1964): _rb > c_. This formulation of kin selection proposes, that helping behavior will be selected towards, when _rb > c_ is true, where r refers to the degree of relatedness, b is the raise of inclusive fitness of the recipient, and c is the cost covered by the helper. Before Hamilton, there was no tenable formulation to explain the conditions of helping behavior.

The predictions of Hamilton’s formula were supported by several studies observing species of insects, birds, and mammals, pointing to the importance kinship plays in the evolution of cooperative breeding. Three general conclusions can be made:

1. the decision of whether to help is highly dependent on kinship,
1. in populations where helping kin are more preferred, helpers have more influence on the recipients,
1. the degree of discrimination among kin increases with the degree of benefits helpers provide (Kramer, 2015).

From these, we can see that in most cooperative breeding populations, helpers usually discriminate positively towards more closely related individuals, when providing help. Thus, it is easy to see, why others can choose to support an individual’s reproductive interest, provided the specific conditions enable the cost/benefit relation proposed by Hamilton.

Turning to the second question kin selection theory addresses, that is, whether helpers really make a difference in maternal fitness and the well-being of the offspring. It has been concluded that cooperative breeders, indeed, have a positive impact on the fitness of the mother and the survival, and health of the child (Kramer, 2010). Kramer also, referring to several studies, emphasized the importance of grandmothers and juveniles participating in breeding activities, whereas both classes of helpers increase the fertility of either their mothers or daughters, by increasing child survivorship and decreasing birth intervals. Furthermore, fathers participating in breeding have similar effects as grandmothers and juveniles, mainly by providing food to both the offspring and the mother.

We can see now that kin-based positive discrimination in the case of providing allomaternal care is beneficent, in several respects, both for the mother and the offspring. This way, it is no mystery why sexually mature helpers engage in such costly behaviors while decreasing their own reproductive chances. The costs and benefits of helping involve various explanations, depending on the helper’s relatedness. These types of relatedness and their corresponding explanations are summarized in the following table (Kramer, 2015, 5. p.):

|HELPER'S RELATION                              |EXPLANATION           |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|Sexually mature, nonbreeding related sibling   |Delayed dispersal, ecological constraints                                                 |
                                                                       |
                                                Indirect fitness benefits (kin selection)        |
|Nonrelated adults                              |Reciprocal altruism   |
|Postreproductive females                       |Kin selection         |
|Fathers                                        |Resource provisioning |
|Juveniles                                      |Benefits of learning and gaining maternal experience                                            |
                                                                       |
                                                |Kin selection         |
                                                                       |
                                                |Age division of labor, mutual benefits, kin selection              |
                                                

What we have already seen, is that kin-based positive discrimination has evolutionary benefits, with an overall higher payoff, given Hamilton’s formula. However, at this point, the question appeared to me, what is the case, where the coefficient of relatedness (_r_) is so low, that we would naturally predict selection against helping? This was the step, where I found myself thinking about different forms of altruism, and realized that kin selection theory only provides a good explanation for specific cases of helping, whereas other cooperative and beneficent behaviors cannot be accounted for only _by rb > c_.

Kramer also raised similar concerns: “_cooperative behaviors may be motivated by factors besides kin selection. Researchers have raised the point that kin selection is an ultimate cause focused on fitness payoffs. Because these payoffs often are time delayed, kin selection may be insufficient to explain the motivation to cooperate._” (Kramer, 2015, 7. p.) My concerns about the feasibility of kin selection as an ultimate explanation of helping seems grounded, so now I will move on to examine, whether altruism could be a possible alternative accounting for different forms of cooperative behaviors with no relatedness present as a motivational factor for preferring helping.

## Altruism and other types of cooperative and beneficient behaviors

First, I would like to examine what the term altruism refers to, in a biological or evolutionary context. The word, in general, is used as an antonym of egoism, from this starting point, we could define altruism in a biological context, as performing an action that is at the cost to the individual performing it, but benefits another individual, either directly or indirectly. A somewhat more precise definition could be made by including some terms used in ethology or social evolution: altruism consists of such behavior, performed by an individual, that increases the fitness of some other individual, whereas decreases the fitness of the actor.

Some definitions of altruism deny the possibility of reciprocity, that is what we can consider as ideal altruism, but for my argument, I would like to examine another form of altruism. Besides kin selection, as a form of altruism where there is the factor of relatedness at play also, we can see a somewhat more refined evolutionary mechanism not necessarily including relatedness: reciprocal altruism.

Reciprocal altruism in evolutionary biology refers to those behaviors, where an organism performs an action in such a manner that it increases the inclusive fitness of another organism, not closely related while reducing its own inclusive fitness, complemented with the expectation towards the organism receiving the benefit to perform a similar action in the future. Robert Trivers first coined the term in an essay published in 1971: _The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism_. In the following section, I briefly summarize his article’s main arguments.

### Trivers’s conception of reciprocal altruism

The main intention of Trivers’s article is to give a reasonable model accounting for the natural selection towards reciprocally altruistic behavior. His concerns towards Hamilton’s kin selection theory have the same basis as mine: “_degree of relationship is an important parameter in predicting how selection will operate, and behavior which appears altruistic may, on knowledge of the genetic relationships of the organisms involved, be explicable in terms of natural selection: those genes being selected for that contribute to their own perpetuation, regardless of which individual genes appear in._” (Trivers, 1971, 35. p.) Trivers argues, that his model is applicable to cases of asymmetric beneficial transactions affecting organisms’ inclusive fitness, where the parties are even members of different species while ruling out kin selections exclusivity by presenting how altruistic behaviors can be selected for.

He begins by introducing an analogy of a human saving another human’s life, by rescuing them from drowning. There is a specific set up for the constellation of cost/benefit ratios and probabilities, but the two main features of this analogy are: (1) there is an asymmetric relation between the cost/benefit ratio of the two parties, and (2) we have to assume a capacity to discriminate between ‘cheaters’ (those who would not reciprocate in the future) and ‘non-cheaters’.

In the first case, what can be said is that the benefits of reciprocity depend on the unequal distribution of the altruistic act’s cost/benefit ratio. This means that the costs paid by the helper are always lower than the benefit received. Complementing this principle, it is easily imaginable that in the case of a reversed scenario, the one who has already helped has the rightful expectation towards the other to pay the same amount of cost in order to gain the higher benefits. By not complying with this principle, if the one who has already been helped, this time not providing help will be labeled as a ‘cheater’ of the principle of reciprocity. Natural selection will select against cheaters if the future disadvantageous effects of cheating outweigh the advantages of not reciprocating. A clear case of this scenario would be if the first donor of an altruistic act would avoid donating any further altruistic gestures to the cheater. When the benefits of such lost possible transactions are greater than the costs of reciprocating, selection will act against the cheater, compared to those engaging in altruistic exchanges.

We can project these conditions to a bigger population, to generalize the argument. Suppose there are altruists and non-altruists in a population, where altruists will always favor being altruistic when the benefits of the recipient are significantly higher than the cost to the altruist. Here cost meaning the “_degree to which the behavior retards the reproduction of the genes of the altruist_”, whereas benefit meaning the “_degree to which the behavior increases the rate of reproduction of the genes of the recipient._” (Trivers, 1971, 36. p.) Now we can assume that allele a2 is responsible for favoring altruistic behavior, while its alternative, a1, is responsible for avoiding altruistic behavior. Trivers distinguishes the following three possibilities:

1. altruism spreads randomly throughout the population,
1. altruism spreads non-randomly, based on kin selection of the recipients,
1. altruism spreads non-randomly, based on the altruistic tendencies of the recipients.

In the first case, altruism spreading randomly, thus being irrespective of the future benefits a reciprocal relationship could have, allele _a1_ will replace allele _a2_, in a large population. In the second case, which has been analyzed extensively by Hamilton (1964), allele _a2_ will replace a1, given that the tendency is great enough for altruism to spread selectively to close kin. In this case, it is assumed necessary for altruists to have a capacity to discriminate between those having allele _a1_ or _a2_. However, this case holds the possibility of parasitism to occur, as the discriminatory capacity does not necessarily involve the capacity to differentiate between actually being close kin to altruists or just acting in such a way to receive the benefits of others’ altruistic acts. In the third case, allele _a2_ will be favorably selected for, given that the net benefit of altruists is greater than that of non-altruists, while holding the net benefit is relatively small, which also decreases the net costs. This scenario will occur, if altruists negatively discriminate towards non-altruists, by diminishing the further possibility of altruistic acts towards the non-altruists.

Given the above-described selective tendencies, Trivers (1971) concludes that altruistic alleles would be favored insomuch as the net average benefit to altruists are greater than the average benefit of non-altruist. This is true in cases where altruists limit their altruistic acts to their fellow altruists. Therefore, compared to Hamilton’s (1964) formulation, this argument will also hold for altruistic acts transferred between individuals of different species.
