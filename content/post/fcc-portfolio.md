# List of my completed assignments

On this page you can find my completed assignments as included in different courses on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

__Note:__ All the API microservices are hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

## APIs and Microservices Course

These are the submitted solutions for the _APIs and Microservices Projects_ section:

1. [Timestamp Microservice](https://fcc-timestamp-dzs.glitch.me)
2. [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://fcc-headerparser-dzs.glitch.me)
3. [URL Shortener Microservice](https://fcc-urlshortener-dzsamboki.glitch.me)
4. [Exercise Tracker](https://fcc-exercisetracker-dzs.glitch.me)
5. [File Metadata Microservice](https://fcc-filemeta-dzs.glitch.me)

Most projects were completed by the golden _'Read, Search, Ask'_ method, whenever I encountered some difficulties I consulted either:
- [FCC's forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/), or
- YouTube tutorials
