# List of my completed assignments

On this page you can find my completed assignments as included in different courses on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

__Note:__ All the API microservices are hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
__Note:__ All the Quality Assurance solutions are hosted on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/).

Using the above-mentioned two tools to host, I managed to get a good understanding of these platforms. However, for editing purposes I found easier creating a local clone of the [GitHub](https://github.com) repository, pushing it to a new remote repository, and hosting them from my own [GitHub](https://github.com) repository.

## APIs and Microservices Course

Most projects were completed by the golden _'Read, Search, Ask'_ method, whenever I encountered some difficulties I consulted either:
- [FCC's forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/), or
- YouTube tutorials
