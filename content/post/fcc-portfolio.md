# List of my completed assignments

On this page you can find my completed assignments as included in different courses on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

__Note:__ All the API microservices are hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
__Note:__ All the Quality Assurance solutions are hosted on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/).

Using the above-mentioned two tools to host, I managed to get a good understanding of these platforms. However, for editing purposes I found easier creating a local clone of the [GitHub](https://github.com) repository, pushing it to a new remote repository, and hosting them from my own [GitHub](https://github.com) repository.

## APIs and Microservices Course

These are the submitted solutions for the _APIs and Microservices Projects_ section:

1. [Timestamp Microservice](https://fcc-timestamp-dzs.glitch.me)
1. [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://fcc-headerparser-dzs.glitch.me)
1. [URL Shortener Microservice](https://fcc-urlshortener-dzsamboki.glitch.me)
1. [Exercise Tracker](https://fcc-exercisetracker-dzs.glitch.me)
1. [File Metadata Microservice](https://fcc-filemeta-dzs.glitch.me)

## Quality Assurance Course

These are the submitted solutions for the _Quality Assurance Projects_ section:

1. [Metric-Imperial Converter](https://fcc-qa-metricimperial-challange.dvidzsmboki.repl.co/)
1. [Issue Tracker](https://fcc-issuetracker-dzs.glitch.me/) __Note:__ This solution is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) due to some errors with MongoDB occurring on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/).
1. [Personal Library](https://fcc-qa-library-dzs.glitch.me/) __Note:__ This solution is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) due to some errors with MongoDB occurring on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/).
1. [Sudoku Solver](https://fcc-qa-sudokusolver.dvidzsmboki.repl.co/)
1. [American British Translator](https://fcc-qa-british-american.dvidzsmboki.repl.co/)

In these challenges the goal was to build test assertions with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for the APIs above, so that you can look at the Functional and Unit Tests, here you can find my source code:

1. [Metric-Imperial Converter Repository](https://github.com/ddyfedd/fcc-qa-metricimperial-challange.git)
1. [Issue Tracker Repository](https://github.com/ddyfedd/fcc-issuetracker.git)
1. [Personal Library Repository](https://github.com/ddyfedd/fcc-qa-library.git)
1. [Sudoku Solver Repository](https://github.com/ddyfedd/fcc-qa-sudokusolver.git)
1. [American British Translator Repository](https://github.com/ddyfedd/fcc-qa-british-american.git)

Most projects were completed by the golden _'Read, Search, Ask'_ method, whenever I encountered some difficulties I consulted either:
- [FCC's forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/), or
- YouTube tutorials
