## The story of becoming a hobby-producer

I always loved music, listening to it, dreaming about making it. When I was 13 years old I got my first bass for my birthday. I begun practicing, having private lessons and soon I gained a solid understanding of basic music theory and some relevant concepts.

Years went by, and I was over a couple bands we tried to organize, but somehow all of them turned out as a thing which required more energy to invest as our lives allowed. Then, after a couple of years I visited my first psychedelic party. The music, the atmosphere and everything the psychedelic scene involved got me into it, and soon the idea came to me to begin producing.

After some years of trying with different DAWs, and not liking what I get from YouTube tutorials, I decided it is time to take things a bit more seriously. That was when I reached out to [Init Preset](https://soundcloud.com/init-preset), with whom we became really good friends since then. After 5 months of watching him doing his stuff, I had my first released track, which - looking at it from my present perspective - is no way my best track. But it is something.

Since then, I have been in a duo project, we made it to a released EP, and I also released 2 other EPs, one by myself, and the other with another good friend, [Napra](https://soundcloud.com/naprapsy):
- [Epistemic Emergence](https://blackoutrec.bandcamp.com/album/epistemic-emergence)
- [Symbiosis](https://warromajarec.bandcamp.com/album/symbiosis-ep)

And on top of these, my 2nd solo release is up on the corner of a couple of months. After one year of my fist one, this release is something I will be proud, the progress is clearly hearable. Stay tuned, and follow me everywhere:
